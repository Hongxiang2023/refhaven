## From saved paper to revised manuscript

- **Collect & organize.** Import PDFs and references, look up PMID/DOI/arXiv metadata, or capture a paper from Chrome or Edge. Use collections, tags, stars, and reading status.
- **Read & annotate.** Keep article text and figures together. Use five highlight colors and passage notes, with the original PDF a click away. Reading caches are removable.
- **Cite & revise.** Generate references from identifiers, export Word, then upload your edited document to refresh citations and the bibliography. Preserve Refhaven’s citation controls between revisions.
- **Choose your storage.** Keep your library local or move it to a folder managed by OneDrive, Google Drive, or Box. After upload, use your provider’s online-only controls for PDFs.

No Refhaven account, subscription, or analytics. Your library is local by default; cloud-folder storage is optional. Identifier lookup and optional AI use external services for their respective tasks. AI uses your own connection and requires per-paper enablement. [Privacy & security](SECURITY.md)

**Browser connector:** Version 0.1.4 is pending Chrome Web Store review as of September 19, 2026, so Store installation is not available yet. You can [set up the unpacked Chrome/Edge connector](docs/user-guide.md#save-papers-with-the-browser-connector) now. Its folder survives app replacement; Chrome Store installation will provide browser-managed updates after approval. Edge Add-ons has not been submitted.

## Download & install

**[Download Refhaven for Mac · Apple silicon (.dmg)](https://github.com/Hongxiang2023/refhaven/releases/download/v0.1.4-preview.1/Refhaven-0.1.4-arm64.dmg)**

macOS 13 or newer. No Node.js or Terminal needed.

1. Open the downloaded `.dmg`.
2. Drag **Refhaven** into **Applications**. Quit an older Refhaven before replacing it.
3. Open **Refhaven** from Applications, then eject the disk image.

**Updating an existing installation?** Back up your library and quit the app before updating. [Installation and update guide](docs/install.md#existing-installations)

**Early preview:** Refhaven is not yet Developer ID-signed or Apple-notarized. If macOS blocks first launch and you trust this download, follow the [first-launch instructions](docs/install.md#if-macos-blocks-the-first-launch). Keep normal macOS security protections enabled.

**Intel Mac, Windows, or Linux:** [Run from source](docs/install.md#source-installation). Installers for these platforms are not provided yet. [Check your Mac & installation help](docs/install.md#macos)

## A PMID is enough

```text
One source (36599988).
Several sources (36599988, 40903587).
A CS paper (arxiv:1706.03762).
```

Paste text or upload Word, choose a citation style, and select **Generate references**. Modern numeric PMIDs work directly; no prefix is needed. Missing identifiers can be looked up automatically. These examples illustrate syntax, not scientific claims.

**Revising?** Edit the exported Word file, add new markers outside existing citation controls, and upload it again. Refhaven refreshes the citations and replaces its managed bibliography. [See the revision workflow](https://hongxiang2023.github.io/refhaven/demo/#revise)

<details>
<summary><strong>DOIs, mixed groups, short PMIDs, and papers without identifiers</strong></summary>

```text
A DOI source (doi:10.1038/nphys1170).
A mixed group (PMID: 36599988; doi:10.1038/nphys1170).
A short PMID (PMID: 12345).
```

For a saved paper without a public identifier, use **Copy citation marker** to obtain its `(folio:...)` marker. Ordinary years and already formatted citation numbers are left alone.

To change a citation’s sources during revision, replace its entire citation control with a new marker. Correct reference metadata in Refhaven, then regenerate. Plain formatted numbers do not retain reference identities. [Complete citation guide](docs/user-guide.md#generate-and-revise-manuscript-references)

Refhaven is an independent early-preview project. PDF extraction can be imperfect; verify important passages against the original. Review metadata and generated references before submission. Cloud folders use your provider’s desktop app and do not support simultaneous shared-library editing. There is no OCR or live Word/Google Docs add-in.

<summary><strong>For developers and contributors</strong></summary>

Install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (22.13 or newer). Clone this repository or [download the source ZIP](https://github.com/Hongxiang2023/refhaven/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), then run these commands in the folder containing `package.json`:

```sh
npm ci
npm run desktop
```

The source ZIP is project code, not the Mac installer. [Step-by-step source setup](docs/install.md#source-installation)

```sh
npm run check          # build, typecheck, and automated tests
npm run dist:desktop   # package locally; does not publish
```

For browser mode, run `npm run build` and `npm start`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:47821/papers`. Stop desktop mode first. For frontend development, keep the local service running and use `npm run dev` in a second terminal.

Automated source checks cover macOS, Windows, and Linux. The downloadable preview targets Apple silicon Macs only.

Report problems with your OS, Refhaven version, reproduction steps, and error message. Prefer fictional examples over private papers or manuscripts. Never share your library folder or credentials.
